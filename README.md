# Avocado-Project
The data was downloaded from the Hass Avocado Board website in May of 2018 & compiled into a single CSV. 

The data represents weekly 2018 retail scan data for National retail volume (units) and price. Retail scan data comes directly from retailers’ cash registers based on actual retail sales of Hass avocados. 

The Average Price (of avocados) in the table reflects a per unit (per avocado) cost, even when multiple units (avocados) are sold in bags. 

The Product Lookup codes (PLU’s) in the table are only for Hass avocados. Other varieties of avocados (e.g. greenskins) are not included in this table.

Some relevant columns in the dataset:

Date - The date of the observation
AveragePrice - the average price of a single avocado
type - conventional or organic
year - the year
Region - the city or region of the observation
Total Volume - Total number of avocados sold
4046 - Total number of avocados with PLU 4046 sold
4225 - Total number of avocados with PLU 4225 sold
4770 - Total number of avocados with PLU 4770 sold

The dataset can be seen in two angles to find the region and find the average price .

I have done both Regression for Average Price and Classification for Region
